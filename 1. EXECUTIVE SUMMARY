QUENNE AI OS

The Cognitive Operating System for Embodied Intelligence

Built upon the unified architecture of the Quantum‑Edge‑Neuromorphic Engine (QUENNE), the QUENNE AI OS is the world’s first cognitive operating system designed for autonomous, resilient, and adaptive intelligence across physical and digital realms. It integrates quantum inference, neuromorphic learning, and edge actuation into a cohesive, self‑regulating computational fabric.

🔑 PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION

1. Uncertainty‑Native – All processes are inherently probabilistic and confidence‑aware.
2. Continuous Learning – The OS never stops adapting; every interaction updates its cognitive models.
3. Embodied Action – Intelligence is grounded in sensorimotor loops and real‑world actuation.
4. Biological Stability – Homeostatic regulation maintains system integrity under stress.
5. Meaning‑Driven – Semantic understanding precedes data processing; context is primary.
